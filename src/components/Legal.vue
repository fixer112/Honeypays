<ol>
<li>To carry on the business of investing funds of the shareholders, associates and partners of the company as well as the general public.</li>
<li>To engage in the business of providing micro-credit facilities and to provide financial and technical assistance and support to individuals, small scale enterprises.</li>
</ol>
<p>HoneyPays Micro Credit Investment Limited is a Non-Banking Financial Institution, duly incorporated under the COMPANY AND ALLIED MATTERS ACT 1990 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘Company’).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice is provided to you in as your legal right, because you are considering dealing with the Company in investing in high-risk derivative financial instruments with which the Company conducts its business (hereinafter the “Financial Instrument”).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This notice cannot and does not disclose or explain all of the risks and significant aspects of the Company’s activities related to dealing in Financial Instruments and is solely designed to explain in general terms the nature of the risks particularly to dealing in Financial Instruments and to help you take decisions on an informed basis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff;"><strong>RISK WARNING</strong></span></h2>
<p>The Client should not use the services of the Company’s Fund Management unless he knows and understands the risks involved for each one of the Financial Instruments with which the Company conducts its business. So, prior to registering an account and making a deposit with the Company, the Client should consider carefully whether the Company’s investing in Financial Instruments is suitable to him in the light of his circumstances and financial resources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Client is warned of the following risk:</p>
<ol>
<li>Under certain market conditions it may be difficult or impossible for the Company to execute an order, therefore the Client can incur significant losses, up to the total depreciation of investments.</li>
<li>Placing Stop Loss Orders serves to limit losses of the Company on behalf of the Client. However, under certain market conditions the execution of a Stop Loss Order may be worse than its stipulated price and the realized losses can be larger than expected.</li>
<li>There is a risk that the Company’s trades in Financial Instruments may be or become subject to tax and/or any other duty for example because of changes in legislation or its personal circumstances. The Company does not warrant that no tax and/or any other stamp duty will be payable. The Client should be responsible for any taxes and/ or any other duty which may accrue in respect in respect of the Company’s trades on behalf of the Client.</li>
<li>The Company will not provide the Client with investment advice relating to investments or possible transactions in investments or make investment recommendations of any kind.</li>
<li>Investing in some Financial Instruments entails the use of “gearing” or “leverage”. In considering whether to engage in this form of investment, the Client should be aware that the high degree of “gearing” or “leverage” is a particular feature of Derivative Financial Instruments. This stems from the margining system application to such trades, which generally involves a comparatively modest deposit or margin in terms of overall contract value, so that a relatively small movement in the underlying market can have a disproportionately dramatic effect on the Company’s trade. If the underlying market movement is in the Company’s favor, the Company may achieve a good profit on behalf of the Client, but an equally small adverse market movement can quickly result in the loss of the Client’s enter deposit. In regard to the Company’s trade in Derivative Financial Instruments, Derivative Financial Instruments is a non-delivery spot transaction giving an opportunity to make profit on changes in currency rates, commodity, stock market indices or share prices called the underlying instrument. The Client should not invest in the Company’s Investment Portfolio unless he is willing to undertake the risks of losing entirely all the money which he has invested and also any additional commissions and other expenses incurred.</li>
<li>The Company may be required to hold the Client’s money in an account that is segregated from other clients and the Company’s money, but this does not guarantee the full protection of the Client’s funds in the event of force majeure circumstances.</li>
</ol>
<p>This notice cannot and does not disclose or explain all of the risk and other significant aspects involved in dealing in all Financial Instrument and investment services provided by the Company.</p>
<p>The Company reserves the right to review and/or amend its Risk Disclosure statements, at its sole discretion, whenever it deems fit or appropriate.</p>
